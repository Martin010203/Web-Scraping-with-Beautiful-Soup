# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup




## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python's Beautiful Soup library. The project includes examples of extracting book categories from a website and scraping tabular data for conversion into a structured DataFrame. These tasks showcase the use of web scraping techniques to gather and process web data efficiently.
## Key Features

- Fetching website data using HTTP requests.

- Parsing HTML using Beautiful Soup.

- Extracting specific elements from web pages, such as categories and tables.

- Converting scraped data into structured formats like Pandas DataFrames.

- Step-by-step examples with clear instructions.
## Technology Used

- Python: Core programming language for the project.

- Beautiful Soup: Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.

- Requests: For sending HTTP requests and retrieving web pages.

- Pandas: To store and manipulate tabular data.
## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the repository:
```
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/web-scraping-with-beautiful-soup.git
cd web-scraping-with-beautiful-soup
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
  python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install the dependencies:

```   
  pip install -r requirements.txt   
```
## Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```
